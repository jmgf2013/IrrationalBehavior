Week 1 Video Lectures: Irrationality
=====================


So when we think about irrationality, what is it about?

It's about the forces that drive our behavior. Some are economic forces and some are social forces.  And in this particular section we are going to look at all kinds of influences on our behavior.

We're also going to look at choice architecture.   We're going to look at how the world around us and how it's structured. Changes how we view things and how we make
decisions.


#1.1 Visual and Decision Illusions (19:16)#

##Bandage Removal Problem

###Hedonic Calculus

How people aggregate information over time.

> The felicific calculus is an algorithm formulated by utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham for calculating the degree or amount of pleasure that a specific action is likely to cause. Bentham, an ethical hedonist, believed the moral rightness or wrongness of an action to be a function of the amount of pleasure or pain that it produced. The felicific calculus could, in principle at least, determine the moral status of any considered act. The algorithm is also known as the utility calculus, the hedonistic calculus and the hedonic calculus. ([wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicific_calculus))

###Experiments by Prof. Dan

1. duration vs. intensity
  * an experience twice as long is not twice as painful
  * short, intense pain is worse than longer, milder pain
2. progression over time
  * It is better to start with higher pain and end with lower pain
3. recuperation
  * allow breaks for recovery

###Conclusions
Nurses followed their intuitions at the cost of their patients' comfort.

they actually had a strong conviction that they knew what the right answer is,
but that was not the right one. 

I started looking at all kinds of behaviors, all kinds of things in
which we have good intuitions, we have good intentions, we trust our intuitions
but in fact, our intuitions are misleading us time after time.


##The Foundation of Irrationality

We think we know the answer, but we are wrong.

###visual illusions all about the way that the brain uses relativity.

two Towers of Pisa, cube patches' color 
* Perceptions of color are relative to their immediate environment.
* We rely on contextual information to make all sorts of judgements and decisions.

###The brain interprets information by incorporating our expectations into our perceptions.

* You look at a small part of the screen. You focus, you look very carefully, and
nevertheless something unexpected happens around the screen, and you're able to ignore it. It's a tremendous ability of human, capacity and the reason for that by the
way, is that we don't see with our eyes. We see with our brains.
* And our brains fill in the information in the way that we expect to see it, not necessarily what it is out there, actually, but what we expect to see.
* Our brains expected to see a particular pattern and that's what we end up seeing. 
* We think we see with our eyes. We think that we observe all the information, but we don't.

###If we fail so easily with vision, we probably make perceptual mistakes in other areas as well.

I think visual illusions are a great metaphor that help us to think about human
thinking. Think about it. We have a huge part of our brain dedicated to vision.
We have a huge part here in the back dedicated to vision, does vision all the
time, bigger part of the brain that is dedicated to anything else.
We do vision many hours of the day. We've evolutionary design to do vision.
If you had to pick one thing that people are good at, it's vision. And nevertheless we have these mistakes. 


> comment: Prof Dan has also confirmed in the video that our brain is so powerful that it could ignore everything it want.   

> An very intelligent filter to remove the noise and extract the pattern.  Results of millions years' of evolution.  Very powerful than any super computer in the world currently.

> The only problem is that our environment has changed so dramatically that some features of our brain which is good at the forest fighting the animals now has some challenge in the new jungle.   

> I guess maybe this is one of the fundamental cause for many of our irrational behaviour.




#1.2 Defaults (19:57)

##Choice Architecture

###Example: Organ donation rates in different countries
* opt-in form vs. opt-out form

We have the illusion of agency, but our decisions are often influenced by:
* environment
* defaults
* complexity
We take the **path of least resistance**.
We don't realize how much **default** matter.
Then we create stories to justify and explain our actions.

###Example: Focus groups
* We need to question the method of self-report.
* looking at their behaviour more clearly rather than their explanations and stories.

>  proberb: Judge a man not by his words, but by his deeds.

###Example: Medical company
* Branded vs. generic
* The old procedure didn't separate preferences from the tendency to stick to the status quo.
* Forced Choice: requires a decision.
* What people really hate is sending letters back.

People generally avoid changes, even if they are minor and even another path is clearly better.

###Example: Doctors with hip replacement patient.
* The path of least resistance is especially likely when deviating from the default is more complex
* Even for highly trained, experienced physicians!

###Example: Jam shopping
* With so many choices, the complexity of the decision overwhelmed the desire to buy jam.
* Defaults can be more influential as complexity increases.

###Example: Retirement saving
* Ways to make you less likely to save for retirement
    * require opt-in
	* provide lots of complex, difficult choices
	* stress the importance of the decision
	



#1.3 Do We Know Our Preferences? (4:04)

When we don't know what we want, we are guided by the environment.

> So there will be no default illusion if you really know what you want.

###Experiment: List 3 or 10 reasons why you love your significant other

* Because thinking of ten reasons is so difficult, people infer that they must not love their partner as much.
* For this reason, people asked for 3 reasons declare greater love than those asked for 10.
* same for BMW, 

###Experiment: 

* just before the students fill in their evaluation for the term, I ask them to think about 15 ways in which this class could be improved.
Presumably, 15 are too many, they run short and they come up to the conclusion this was a fantastic class and this is how they fill the end of the year evaluation.
* I do it just before they fill in the end of year evaluation, now I can
change their momentary mindset, their momentary understanding of how good this class is, and then I can get higher teaching evaluations.



#1.4 Choice Sets and Relativity (15:11)

###Experiment: how often do you floss per day/month.
* Answering on the left side of the scale implies you are below the norm, and answering on the right implies you are above the norm
* Your temporary change in mindset may affect imminent decisions but will decay over time.

###Case: financial advisor
* Your temporary mindset could determine the starting point of your portfolio, safe or risky.
* If you make decision under those mindset, those initial decisions could affect your portfolio for years to come.
* Next year when you discuss your portfolio with your advisor, you will start from the result of the last year's decision.
* A change in momentary mindset can have a significant, long-term effect.

###Experiment: travel plan offer
* Asymmetric Dominance
* The contrast makes the desirable option more attractive.

###Case: Economist subscription offer
* The Decoy Effect (Asymmetric Dominance)
* The middle option defined the framework for evaluating the other options.
* The relative comparison between the two versions makes the print & web subscription look much better.

1. It is really hard for us to make evaluations.
2. Decisions are influenced by choice sets.

###Book: The Darwen Economy, by Robert Frank
* sea lions
* The constant race for a relatively better position can threaten an entire ecosystem.

###Experiment: dating choice
* Choose from Tom, Ugly Jerry, and Jerry, or Tom, Ugly Tom, and Jerry.



#1.5 The Long-lasting Effects of Decisions (22:09)

###Case: buying coffee
* standard Rational Model of Valuation
    * value is equated with price
	* more pleasure = more money
	* less pleasure = less money
* Self Herding Model
    * Our tendency to follow the same decisions we have made in the past 
	* Future decisions are influenced by previous decisions.
    * **We remember our actions far better than our transient emotional states.**  And we tend to think we always made fantastic decisions.
* Starbucks has worked to differentiate its brand so that people would compare them to cheaper coffee brand.   Because of those superficial things, we did not compare the two directly and we were willing to treat Starbucks as a new category of decision and accept whatever price they were offering to us.
	
	
###Case: last two digits of social security number and auction
* anchor effect
* Once a particular number is introduced, it becomes the reference point from which prices are judged (the "anchor")
* Basically, people start with their starting point, even if it's random, and stay close to that.
* Once you choose a specific product, other products in the same category follow a particular trend and remains in a relative good position.   Relative comparisons of products in the same category remain fixed.  But you can swith everything up or down quite easily because of anchor effect.
* The first decision becomes an anchor that influences future decsions.

###Case: Tom Sawyer, the painter of the fence, by Mark Twain
* Mark Twain showed how the exact same experience can be regarded as good or bad, depending on how it is presented, or framed.
* Because our pre-existing preferences are often undefined, value can be constructed through arbitrary influences.

###Experiment: Prof. Dan's poetry recital valuation

###Experiment: Ducklings following the first figure they see after hatching, by Conrad Lawrence

###Case: iPhone's price
* The first iPhone introduced at $600, then Apple reduce it to $400 quickly.
* We are relative, comparative creatures.  We're looking at price in relative way.
* Internet start with free policy
* Once a product is introduced in a certain way, that becomes a permanet point of reference.    



#1.6 Learning from Our Mistakes (9:58)

###Three main lessons from behavioral economics

1. We have many decision biases.
2. Our intuitions are often wrong, and we don't recognize our faults.
3. We need to rely on empirical evidence from experiments to accurately analyze our behavior.

###Case: FDA forces physicians to do experiments

I think we need the same discipline for governments and businesses.
We should test government and business policies before implementing them.

###Memento Mori, in Roman times
* remember, you're mortal

Remember that we're limited.
Remember that we're irrational.
Remember that we have all of these decisions problems, and we need to think about how to test ourself and check ourself and don't trust our intuition to a high degree.


###Prefered method: Computer hacker's way
* they take a procedure and they write it in exact details.
* they look at the whole sequence, very, very long sequence of things that can happen.
* They figure out which points are best to intervene.

###Basical recipe for how to take social science research and make it applicable

We want to look at the small details of how something happens. 

* How do we enroll in the retirement plan?
* And how do you enroll in organ donation?
* And how do you decide what TV to get and so on?

And then we want to find out where can we interfere in? Where can we get things to behave differently, and where can we improve
things? 


###The big lesson from me, from all of social science
* **doubt our intuitions.**
* **experiment more**.
* You should ask yourself, why am I making this decision? Is it because it's really better, or I just think so?
* And if it's only because I just think so, maybe it's the right time to try something else.
* And for particularly for things we are going to make decisions over and over and over, there is huge potential payoff in trying something out and seeing whether it leads to better efforts.
