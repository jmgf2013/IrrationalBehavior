Week 1 Video Lectures: Irrationality
=====================


So when we think about irrationality, what is it about?

It's about the forces that drive our behavior. Some are economic forces and some are social forces.  And in this particular section we are going to look at all kinds of influences on our behavior.

We're also going to look at choice architecture.   We're going to look at how the world around us and how it's structured. Changes how we view things and how we make
decisions.

###Hedonic Calculus

How people aggregate information over time.

> The felicific calculus is an algorithm formulated by utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham for calculating the degree or amount of pleasure that a specific action is likely to cause. Bentham, an ethical hedonist, believed the moral rightness or wrongness of an action to be a function of the amount of pleasure or pain that it produced. The felicific calculus could, in principle at least, determine the moral status of any considered act. The algorithm is also known as the utility calculus, the hedonistic calculus and the hedonic calculus. ([wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicific_calculus))

###Experiments by Prof. Dan

1. duration vs. intensity
  * an experience twice as long is not twice as painful
  * short, intense pain is worse than longer, milder pain

2. progression over time
  * It is better to start with higher pain and end with lower pain
3. recuperation
  * allow breaks for recovery

###Conclusions
Nurses followed their intuitions at the cost of their patients' comfort.

they actually had a strong conviction that they knew what the right answer is,
but that was not the right one. 

I started looking at all kinds of behaviors, all kinds of things in
which we have good intuitions, we have good intentions, we trust our intuitions
but in fact, our intuitions are misleading us time after time.


##The Foundation of Irrationality

We think we know the answer, but we are wrong.

* Perceptions of color are relative to their immediate environment.
* We rely on contextual information to make all sorts of judgements and decisions.

###The brain interprets information by incorporating our expectations into our perceptions.

* You look at a small part of the screen. You focus, you look very carefully, and
nevertheless something unexpected happens around the screen, and you're able to ignore it. It's a tremendous ability of human, capacity and the reason for that by the
way, is that we don't see with our eyes. We see with our brains.
* And our brains fill in the information in the way that we expect to see it, not necessarily what it is out there, actually, but what we expect to see.
* Our brains expected to see a particular pattern and that's what we end up seeing. 
* We think we see with our eyes. We think that we observe all the information, but we don't.

###If we fail so easily with vision, we probably make perceptual mistakes in other areas as well.

I think visual illusions are a great metaphor that help us to think about human
thinking. Think about it. We have a huge part of our brain dedicated to vision.
We have a huge part here in the back dedicated to vision, does vision all the
time, bigger part of the brain that is dedicated to anything else.
We do vision many hours of the day. We've evolutionary design to do vision.
If you had to pick one thing that people are good at, it's vision. And nevertheless we have these mistakes.
