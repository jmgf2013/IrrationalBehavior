Managing Your Time (6:07)
=========================

#Procrastinate#

You're probably starting this class thinking that you're going to do all the 
work. And, you'll be 100% with the class. Except that you're human, just like all 
the rest of us. So probably, you'll procrastinate. 

*Procrastination doesn't have to be counterproductive. *

##Planning Fallacy##

A big contributor to procrastination is what Kahneman and Tversky would call the 
planning fallacy. Basically, the planning fallacy says that even when we have a lot of experience with something, we still tend to underestimate the amount of time it'll 
take us. 

So, the next time you have something to plan for, an assignment or a quiz for 
example, try estimating, it'll take you twice as long and then it might get done 
on time. 

#Deadlines are important#

some researches that Dan conducted with Klaus Wertenbroch. This study basically looked at whether people spontaneously set deadlines for themselves, and if they do, how optimally they set these deadlines. 

It doesn't really matter who sets the deadlines, just that they're evenly spaced. 
So, bottom line, in the face of self-control problems like procrastination, smart deadlines help.

#Spend your time wisely#

One way to do this is through testing. It can really help you retain information. 
when we're passively absorbing information and everything seems to make sense, we're not aware of those gaps in our understanding that really only reveal themselves once we try to retrieve that information. 

Once we try to fill in those gaps, we start to learn more. 

*It turns out that highlighting is mostly a waste of time. *
