Irrational Behavior
==================

Study notes for Prof [Dan Ariely](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Ariely)'s online course: [A Beginner's Guide to Irrational Behavior](https://www.coursera.org/course/behavioralecon)

Session: Mar 25th 2013 (6 weeks long).	
Workload: 7-10 hours/week.

The official online course website is full of videos, txts, and ppts.

The majority part of the study notes for video lectures has been copied and pasted directly from the official subtitles.   External materials and comments from myself are in the format of blockquotes.
